## Technologies
>  To build the mobile application, the React Native framework version 0.60.4 created and still developed by Facebook was used. It allows you to create applications for iOS and Android in JavaScript.
   The project also uses PHP in a version higher than version 5.4.45. It was implemented with the help of its API, providing resources and functionalities allowing for the placement and use of data stored in the MySQL relational database version 5.6.37-82.2. To test the functionality of the application, access to hosting containing one 2 GB MySQL database was purchased.
